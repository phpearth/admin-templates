Hello,

thank you for sharing a job opportunity with us. There is, however, one big issue with that ad. It requires a certain gender only.

A bit of a story for the better understanding of this issue. Programming was once a field dominated by women. Then all of a sudden somehow things turned around and some stereotype came to be that this is a work for antisocial males only. Now, we're trying to fix this weird belief system that got to some people. We need to make sure that everyone is aware that certain gender does not affect the cognitive skills in any way. A fun fact, the first programmer was a lady - Ada Lovelace [1].

So it is of great importance to offer equal chances in your job opportunities to all people who have proper skills no matter their gender. Gender equality is very important for our society [2].

Please note that gender equality is one of our common global goals on this planet by 2030 [3], so it would be really good to join us and help us make this a reality. With people like you, we'd be there in no time.

If anything else, work related discrimination for such job opportunities is illegal in most countries anyway.
