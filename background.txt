Hello,

thank you for sharing your post with us. Please note that using backgrounds in Facebook groups degrades readability a bit. Specially if these backgrounds include extremely prominent colors such as red or pink.

For questions and text posts using normal white background increases overall group readability.

Unfortunately at the time of this writing there is no way to disable this feature on a group level yet.

We've done also a quick survey. [1]

More useful information is available in the group guides [1] and in the RFC 1855 [3] how to communicate in these groups, forums, or mailing lists in general.

Thank you for maybe considering adjusting your posting next time and using a normal background.
