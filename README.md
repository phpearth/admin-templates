# Admin templates

These are some common templates and examples for giving repeated answers in the
[PHP group on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2204685680/).

Some templates also include optional image to be attached at the answer.

Note that these are optional for each admin to use as they want. User should not
expect to receive these templates every time for every case since each situation
is different. However, these might help administrators manage group better and
simpler.
