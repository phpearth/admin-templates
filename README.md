# Admin templates

These are some common templates and examples for giving repeated answers in the
[PHP group on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2204685680/).

Some templates also include optional image to be attached at the answer:

Current list of templates:

* [Attachment unavailable](attachment-unavailable.txt)

  This answer is given in some cases where there is a notice from FB on the post
  saying `attachment unavailable`.

* [books](books.txt)

  This comment is added when someone shares books that shouldn't be distributed
  by sharing them online on 3rd party sites.
